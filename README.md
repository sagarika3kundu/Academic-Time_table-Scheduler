<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project has been built using Java and Swing GUI. The objective of the project is to successfully show a time-table w.r.t. each section and each instructor in the frontend. The backend must be able to efficiently create an Academic Time-Table where given the courses, instructors, rooms, sections and time-slot for each class as csv files as inputs, the algorithm must alot each course to an empty room for the span of the lecture. Each instructor has an expertise and that must be taken into consideration while alloting the lectures to the instructor. Also, to avoid overburdening any lecturer, the algorithm must efficiently use the exhaustive list of all instructors of the required expertise. This project was a course-project. Here I definitely learned how complicated issues are being dealt with and the approach for them. Though we might not be able to produce the most efficient scheduler, but one must take into consideration various other factors like the overburdening of the instructors on allocating them all lectures on the very same day, and how we can span that effectively over a week. Also, if a lecturer has expertise in multiple fields, the scheduler must not allocate the same courses for the lecturer consecutively as that might lead to monotonic delivery of a lecture by the instructor reducing the efficiency of the lecturer. It is important to note that the ultimate aim is that we must try to achieve beyond the theoretical "optimal" solution. The most optimal solution here may save on time but will adversely affect the performance of the lecturer.
